Enterprise networks are shifting toward hybrid cloud.
Tossing an extra firewall in your network
Shrink-wrapping security close to a cloud asset
All of the above

Pushes it away from the flat local area network to reduce APT risk
None of the above
CASB is man-in-the-middle
It is something to be managed
None of the above
